# Day 83 - Professional Portfolio Project - Python Scripting
## Assignment: Tic Tac Toe
Build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game.
## Assignment instructions
Using what you have learnt about Python programming, you will build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game. The game should be playable in the command line just like the Blackjack game we created on Day 11. It should be a 2-player game, where one person is "X" and the other plays "O".

This is a simple demonstration of how the game works:

You can choose how you want your game to look. The simplest is to create a game board using "|" and "_" symbols. But the design is up to you.

If you have more time, you can challenge yourself to build an AI player to play the game with you.
